# **DEMO CRUD API!**

### Description
It is basic crud api built using nodejs, express and typescript. It is a simple api that can be used to create, read, update and delete users. It uses a json file as a database. It also gives a glimpse about how to use authorization headers.

```bash
npm i express
npm i nodemon
npm i dotenv
npm install -g typescript
npm install
```

This can be extended to real life use using mongodb database instead of json file.
